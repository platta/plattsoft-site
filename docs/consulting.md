<h5 class="card-title">Cloud Architecture</h5>
<p class="card-text" markdown="1">
I have experience and certifications in both AWS and OpenStack. If you are
building a new application in the cloud or moving an existing application to the
cloud, I can help you design the best architecture for it. I always start with
vendor best practices and build from my experience to ensure your platform will
be secure, highly scalable, highly available, and cost efficient.

<p class="card-text" markdown="1">
Whether you need to optimize a workflow or automate it entirely, I can help.
There are many tools to achieve various types of automation. I can help you
identify which tools are the right fit for your needs. Then, together we can
build an automation pipeline that will be robust, efficient, and traceable. My
automation efforts have saved clients thousands of man hours and mitigated
countless human-error risks.

I may have my head in the cloud these days, but my first love will always be
Software Engineering. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, a Masters
in Software Engineering, and over a decade of experience building, debugging,
and tuning business software. With experience in every stage of the Software
Development Life Cycle I know I will be an asset to your team no matter where
you need me.
