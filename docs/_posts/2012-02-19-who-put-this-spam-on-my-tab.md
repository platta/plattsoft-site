The next time you receive text message spam, watch out! It's apparently possible
for a third party to add services to your account without your consent. I
received a text from "Horoscopegenie Alert" at short code 27140 (the "phone
number" that shows on the message). It said I would be charged $9.99 a month and
to reply STOP to cancel the subscription.

I ignored the message, thinking that any response from me would only elicit
additional spam, but when I went to pay my bill at the end of the month there
was an actual charge for this service. Thankfully my carrier was able to refund
the charge and also put additional security in place on my account. Now, any
"mobile purchases" require a PIN, which should prevent third parties from adding
things to my account without my knowledge. Mobile purchases include things like
this horoscope scam as well as things like "Text XXX to YYY now to buy this
ringtone!" Other things like App Store purchases on an iPhone are something
different, which means I'll probably never actually need the PIN.

So read those spam texts carefully, and don't hesitate to check with your
carrier about applying a PIN to mobile purchases on your account.
