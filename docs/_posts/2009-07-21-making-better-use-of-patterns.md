Software Patterns are very useful. They provide us with common solutions to
related, but distinct, problems.

Modern software IDEs like Visual Studio have become extremely adept at
understanding and manipulating source code. With Intellisense, static checking,
and powerful refactoring tools, code is becoming more and more like clay in
developers' hands.

I wonder what additional power could be added to IDEs if they were able to
understand source code in terms of patterns.

For example, Visual Studio allows you to decorate classes and methods with
various properties. Imagine being able to label a class as a Repository or a
Singleton. This could aid code analysis tools in diagramming and organizing its
representations of your code. It could even allow these advanced tools to
automatically piece together the building blocks of your application in the most
efficient way possible based on the patterns you have used.
