Analogies are an effective way of communicating knowledge of one domain by
mapping the domain's concepts to another similar domain that is known by that
person. In this way, a person can gain understanding of domain B through their
existing knowledge of domain A.

There is, however, a possible third player in this scenario - an abstract
concept through with domains A and B are related in the context of the analogy.
We can view the two domains that the analogy connects as subclasses of an
abstract parent class.

I thought this was a huge revelation, until I realized it's also the foundation
of books like the Gang of Four's _Design Patterns_, and Fowler's _Analysis
Patterns_. Even if it's not a new discovery, realizing that this concept was key
in the derivation of those patterns makes it easy to see how it's possible to
derive new patterns every day to aid us both in Software Engineering and in
everyday life.
