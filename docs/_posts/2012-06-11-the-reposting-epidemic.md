I've been seeing an interesting trend ever since Pinterest has begun to rise in
popularity - repost fever. I know this feature has existed in different ways on
many social networks, but it seems to me that the usage of repost functionality
on these networks has been changing recently.

I think there are two reasons for this:

1. Repost functionality is beginning to be offered by the more popular social
   networks. Even Facebook now has a "share" option for links, images, and
   events.
2. The level of integration between social networks in general is growing very
   rapidly. Not only can you repin someone else's pin on Pinterest, but you can
   share it out to Twitter or Facebook at the same time.

Don't get me wrong, I love having the ability to easily pass interesting videos,
stories, and images on to my friends. What makes me sad about this influx of
sharing, though, is the fact that it's causing a decrease in the amount of
original content I'm seeing, and an increase in the amount of sappy sayings on
top of pictures of puppies and "me too" posts I have to scroll through to get to
anything original. It's gotten to the point where some people don't seem to do
anything _but_ repost things that others have made.

Don't believe me? Okay, fine. But tell me, how many times has this video shown
up in your Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or Google+ feed?

It makes me wonder: is there a point where increasing communication and the
ability to share information between people actually begins to cause a decrease
in creativity? Considering the cleverness of that guy's marriage proposal,
obviously not across the board. Still, I keep thinking that the overwhelming
amount of content being pumped through our social networks must be having some
kind of detrimental effect on us.
