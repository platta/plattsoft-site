Recently, a friend of mine asked me what I thought of the "horizontal lines"
symbol that is being used more and more frequently to indicate where to click or
tap to get to a navigation menu. I really had to take some time to think about
it, because I realized I don't usually pay very close attention to the symbols
used on buttons in the apps that I use.

I spent a couple of days paying attention to what's on my buttons, and I noticed
the horizontal lines in all sorts of places. I also noticed that, although the
symbol was most commonly used to represent access to a menu, horizontal lines
are used represented a number of different functions. This was in contrast to
the other common symbols I saw in use, which overwhelmingly represent the same
thing across the board. One important caveat to all of this is that I only
observed symbols in the apps that I normally use, which means I only saw apps on
iOS between my iPhone and iPad.

Below are six examples of where I've seen the horizontal lines symbol used. I
took a 64&#215;64 snapshot of each, and I'm showing them here at double their
original size. Without the context surrounding each one, can you tell what they
are for?

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <img src="http://45.55.182.154/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Horizontal-Bars-Teaser.jpg" id="blogsy-1365606696198.4417" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="384" height="256" />
</div>

Let's take a closer look at them, each in its original context (all of the
following images are shown at half size, because retina displays make things
huge).

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;">
  <img src="http://45.55.182.154/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Horizontal-Bars-1.jpg" id="blogsy-1365606696125.7502" class="alignright" alt="" width="320" height="130" />
</div>

Item number one is from OmniFocus (shown here on my iPhone), the app that I use
for my to-do list. Now that we can see the horizontal bars in context, we can
see that they are used here to represent the iOS action of sorting a list. This
usage has been around since the earliest days of iOS. It's used in native iOS
apps as well as third party ones, and doesn't require the developer to create
any custom graphics. In this context, the lines could represent the items in the
list that you are reordering. I've also heard it suggested that this usage is
skeuomorphism. The three horizontal bars could be meant to appear as a rough
surface where you finger can gain traction so that, instead of scrolling through
the list, you actually move the list item up or down.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;">

</div>

The second image is from the Fandango app on my iPad. When shown in context,
it's fairly easy to see that this control allows the user to select between a
thumbnail view (left, currently selected) and a list view (right) of the
available movies. In this case, the symbols used on each button are a visual
representation of what the rest of the view will look like when that option is
selected. The controls' location at the top of the screen also helps to indicate
that they affect the main view.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;">

</div>

Item number three is from Apple's Reminders app. This is a list of restaurants I
started, so that I remember new places I want to eat at. I always think of them
as I pass them on the road, but forget about them when I'm actually hungry. The
usage of the horizontal bars in this case is the same as what we saw in
OmniFocus. When you go into edit mode, you can rearrange the items on your list
of reminders. Notice, in this case, that Apple has provided a custom appearance
for the symbol. I'm pretty sure the one in OmniFocus is just the standard one
that is built into iOS.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;">
  <img src="http://45.55.182.154/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Horizontal-Bars-4.jpg" id="blogsy-1365606696136.468" class="alignright" alt="" width="320" height="52" />
</div>

Image number four is also from the Reminders app. This is very interesting,
because **now we have a direct conflict of meaning**. Tapping on the horizontal
bars in this context isn't how you access the functionality of rearranging your
reminders, you have to tap the Edit button for that. In this context, the three
horizontal bars bring up a menu, a list of the different reminders lists you
have created. This may include lists associated with different accounts, such as
iCloud or an Exchange account.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;">
  <img src="http://45.55.182.154/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Horizontal-Bars-5.jpg" id="blogsy-1365606696121.5278" class="alignright" alt="" width="460" height="42" />
</div>

The fifth image is from the app Blogsy, which I use to write most of my posts
for the site. Surprise! It's our old friend the bulleted list. This is quite
possibly the original usage of this symbol. Although you could argue that the
bullet point dots next to the bars make it a different symbol, I've seen the two
used interchangeably in different contexts.

* * *

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;">
  <img src="http://45.55.182.154/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Horizontal-Bars-6.jpg" id="blogsy-1365606696170.1868" class="alignright" alt="" width="477" height="67" />
</div>

The final image is from the Find My Friends app. Like I mentioned above, the
horizontal bars symbol with or without the bullet point dots is used
interchangeably by many apps. In Find My Friends, this button brings up the list
of people who have shared their location with you. The inclusion of the bullet
point dots here is most likely because the list shows each person's contact
image to the left of the details. Much like the Fandango app, the symbol used on
this button is a visual representation of the data it lets you access.

* * *

These are only six of the many places where I saw the horizontal bars symbol
used. Remember, I was only paying close attention for a couple of days, and also
only really looking at iOS apps on an iPhone or iPad. Even with this limited
sampling, it's easy to see that the horizontal bars symbol is heavily dependent
on context to convey its meaning. I noticed many other symbols with common
meanings, but the functions those symbols represented were much more consistent
than what I've seen with these horizontal bars.

The conclusion that I drew from this exercise is that we have to be careful what
symbols we put on our buttons. It's not always enough to think about what visual
representation makes sense for the function we attach to it. We also have to
consider if that symbol, or similar symbols, are commonly used to represent
other functions, and if the surrounding context will be enough to help the users
infer our intent.
