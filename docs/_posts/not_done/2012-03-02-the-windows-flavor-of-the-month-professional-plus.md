There is a story over at [The
Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/2/2838822/windows-8-professional-plus-edition)
about how there might be a new edition of Windows available in Windows 8, the
"Professional Plus" edition.  This is based on a string found in the registry of
the Consumer Preview of Windows 8 (which is fantastic, if fairly buggy).

The full list from the article is:

- Windows 8 Starter Edition
- Windows 8 Home Basic Edition
- Windows 8 Home Premium Edition
- Windows 8 Professional Edition
- Windows 8 Professional Plus Edition
- Windows 8 Enterprise Edition
- Windows 8 Ultimate Edition
- Windows 8 ARM Edition

8 is everywhere you look!

Interestingly, this would mean a grand total of **eight** editions of Windows
**8**.  Combine that with the default desktop wallpaper in the Consumer Preview,
a fish whose air bubbles create an inverted number "8" swimming in a blue sea
with a giant "8" in the background, and it seems like Microsoft might be getting
a little obsessed with that number.  I guess I can't blame them, Windows 8 is
looking like a huge upgrade and a drastic departure from existing Windows
concepts (in a good way!).

Am I the only one who thinks that "Windows 8 LEG Edition" should also be an
option?
