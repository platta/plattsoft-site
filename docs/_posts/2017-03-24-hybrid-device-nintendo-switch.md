  Nintendo's hybrid device, the Switch has been hugely popular. What does this
  tell us about the future of hybrid devices in general?

I've had my Nintendo Switch for just over twenty four hours, but I've been
thinking a lot about the innovation that Nintendo brought to the table with
their latest console. There is a lot of discussion to be had about specifics but
that's not what I've been focusing on. On a high level, Nintendo's hybrid
device has brought something to console gaming that we've been enjoying in the
PC laptop space for some time.

## A hybrid device's home: the docking station

Some laptops or tablets connect via a USB port. Other manufacturers have even
created proprietary ports that allow tighter integration and a cleaner form
factor. Regardless of how you get connected, laptop and tablet users have
enjoyed docking stations for years.

Using a laptop on the go can feel limiting. Trackpads are usable, but not ideal.
Some smaller laptops don't even have full size keyboards, and hardly any of them
have a number pad. Having a docking station at your desk takes all that away. As
soon as you connect, you have access to a mouse and keyboard, additional
monitors, and who knows how many other devices you might have plugged in.

Owning a laptop or tablet with a corresponding docking station yields the best
of both worlds. You have a workstation that feels "full size" but can easily
take your work on the go. That's the same thing Nintendo tried to do with the
Switch. You have a full-featured console experience at home that you can take
with you when you leave the house.

## The merging of desktop and mobile

This trend first began with PC operating systems. iOS and Mac OS X began sharing
features and becoming more like one another. Microsoft Windows and the Windows
Phone platform grow more similar all the time. A future step of this merging is
at the hardware level.

I firmly believe we will reach a point in time when hybrid devices will be the
standard. Your phone will be your laptop or your desktop, depending on what
shell you dock it with. What Nintendo is showing us with the Switch is that
general purpose computers aren't the only technology that will go this way. I
don't know how many years it will take, but I think eventually all game consoles
will act as both home and mobile consoles.

## What I'm not saying

I want to be clear. I'm not saying that the Nintendo Switch is a perfect example
of how to implement this hybrid pattern. I will say I'm enjoying my Switch so
far but, again, I've only had it for a day. There are also a number of issues
people have reported such as:

- Many users experienced disconnect issues with the left joycon.
- Some have reported inserting and removing the Switch from the dock
  causing scratches on the glass.
- I myself have had some issues with the motion controls "drifting" in The
  Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
- The placement of the power port on the bottom of the system makes it
  impossible to charge while playing on a table top with the kickstand.

I'm not saying anything either way about the quality of the Switch as an example
of a hybrid device (not in this post anyway). What I _am_ focusing on is the
evolution of the hybrid device as a concept.

Companies have been building hybrid tablet/laptops for years. As technology
advances, we are seeing these hybrids become more robust and more common. Now,
the Nintendo Switch has brought the hybrid device into the gaming world. I
believe this trend will only continue. What do _you_ think? Let me know in the
comments.
