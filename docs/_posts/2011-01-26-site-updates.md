I've got a few new goodies set up on the site including

* The [Disqus](http://disqus.com) commenting system - which means you can log in
  using your twitter or facebook id to post comments instead of having to create
  an account on the site!
* [Gravatars](http://en.gravatar.com/), globally recognized avatars. Set up a
  free account and provide an image to use as your avatar, and all sites that
  support Gravatar will just pick that image up automatically.
* Updated look and layout, including new logo. I've been working hard on
  polishing the look of the site

I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about the logo, and I still have to make a
favicon, but overall I'm pleased with how things are turning out.

Have a comment about the way the site looks? Let me know!
