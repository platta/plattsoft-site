The interface that Apple provides to its users on the iPhone and iPad for
downloading third party applications has been wildly successful, and now that
same experience is coming to the Mac. The creation of iPhone OS (now iOS) when
the first iPhone was released forced Apple to rethink many things about a
device's operating system and the way in which the user interacts with it. No
doubt, many valuable lessons were learned and it's impossible that the iPhone
and iPad would be so popular if that weren't the case. I believe extending the
App Store to the Mac is, for Apple, a step towards bringing those lessons to OS
X.

Why has the App store been so successful in the first place? Here are a few
reasons I can think of, although I'm sure there are more.

* Consistent experience - The app store provides a single, consistent look and
  feel for all of its products. Users only havet o learn the purchasing process
  once.
* Developer exposure - Since the app store is entirely managed by Apple,
  developers and software shops of all sizes and levels of experience have
  roughly the same level of exposure. This is especially appealing to smaller
  companies and single-man operations.
* Low pricing - Because the developer incurs practically no overhead for making
  their product available on the app store, app prices can be very low while
  still providing a profit. Many apps in the app store are priced at only $0.99.
* Single account - One user name and password to remember makes many users
  breathe a sigh of relief. This also removes the apprehension many feel when
  considering purchasing a product from a small, unfamiliar website asking for
  credit card information. The app store uses your iTunes store account, an
  arena where Apple has earned the loyalty of most shoppers.
* Managed updates - All apps have the ability to make updates available. Since
  Apple has provided the framework through which these updates are delivered,
  users are not afraid to update their software. There is no file to download,
  find, and run. There is no question of whether or not to remove the old
  version first. The app store's update system provides users with a higher
  level of confidence that their software is cleanly and correctly installed.

The big question is: **Will the App store continue to see success on the Mac?**
I think so. Although Apple and its products are often the topic of heated
debate, it's important to remember the company's target demographic: people who
want a computer that just works. The app store provides the kind of
functionality these users desire. There are no installation wizards with a dozen
"Next" buttons to click, and customization options with which they are not
concerned.

All of the benefits that the app store will bring with it from iOS to OS X will
enhance the user experience by making more software available to the kinds of
users that wouldn't be adventurous enough to download it on their own. Even
users that would be comfortable with this are likely to opt for the app stoe's
ease.

I am very curious to see what Apple's next move will be in merging the tightly
controlled, highly secure, stable iOS with the more open, more powerful, more
flexible OS X. I am more certain every day that their fusion is only a matter of
time.
