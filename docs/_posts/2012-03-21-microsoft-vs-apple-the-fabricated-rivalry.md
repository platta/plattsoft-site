I spotted this headline today:

[Microsoft banning Mac, iPad purchases by its sales and marketing group?](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-banning-mac-ipad-purchases-by-its-sales-and-marketing-group/12221?tag=mantle_skin;content)

It's a great example of the way that the "rivalry" between Microsoft and Apple
is, at times, pretty exaggerated. You can check out the full article for the
alleged e-mail defining this new policy, but here is the gist.

> Microsoftâ€™s Sales, Marketing, Services, IT, & Operations Group (SMSG) may be
> putting in place a policy to prevent employees from using corporate funds to
> buy Macs and iPads.

Microsoft and Apple are competitors, let's be clear about that. As such, I
expect Microsoft to take steps to promote its own brand, and to strive for
consistency in the message it delivers to its employees and its customers. On
the careers page of Microsoft's site, the SMSG is
[billed](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/gbl/smsg.aspx) as being "on the
customer frontline." The responsibilities listed on this page include both
internal and customer facing duties, which means these folks do a huge amount of
company representation.

Do you think Pepsi wants its delivery truckers drinking Coke? I assure you, they
don't. A quick search will reveal some of the stories of how employees have even
had their jobs threatened for drinking the competitor's products.

So, really, what does this story tell us? A company may have enacted a policy to
prevent employees from using a competitor's products for business purposes. More
importantly, to prevent employees who _represent the company internally and
externally on a daily basis_ from diluting its brand strength by showing up
with a competitor's technology in tow. If this story was about any two other
companies, would this even be worth mentioning?
