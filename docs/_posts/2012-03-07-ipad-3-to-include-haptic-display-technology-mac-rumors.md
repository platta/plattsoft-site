I spotted this story on [MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com) this morning. It
seems a bit outlandish, but it's still cool to think about: [iPad 3 to Include
Haptic Display Technology to Provide On-Screen Textures? - Mac
Rumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/07/ipad-3-to-include-haptic-display-technology-to-provide-on-screen-textures/).

How cool would this be? It would certainly fit with the message on Apple's
invitations to today's media event. Again, it's not something that seems
terribly likely considering the drastic resolution upgrade we are already
expecting and the amount of info that has already been leaked about the new
display purported to appear in the iPad 3 (or iPad HD, who knows what they will
call it). Another consideration is the amount of battery power required to power
a touch feedback system. Apple's Media Event is scheduled to start at 10:00 AM
Pacific time.

A company called Senseg is cited in the article as the provider of the touch
feedback technology. A quick look at their site brought me
[here](http://senseg.com/technology/senseg-technology), where they include a
brief explanation of how their technology works. It's a very interesting
concept, and it looks like the company has a solid product which may well work
its way into mainstream technology. Will that day be today? Who knows!
