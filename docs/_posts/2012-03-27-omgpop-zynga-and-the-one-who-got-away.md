As many casual gamers already know, the company Omgpop, makers of the mobile
sensation Draw Something, was acquired by Zynga, makers of Farmville, Words with
Friends, and many other popular social and/or casual games. This morning I saw
an
[artible](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/167244/Turning_down_Zynga_Why_I_left_after_the_210M_Omgpop_buy.php)
on Gamasutra about the one Omgpop employee that didn't sign on to continue
working under Zynga.

The lone holdout's name is Shay Pierce, and he's got a few reasons for his
decision that are perfectly logical, and quite admirable. He explains them very
well himself in the Gamasutra article, so I wont' bother repeating them, but I
have a lot of respect for anyone who can stand up for themselves in this way in
today's world.

So what is Shay Pierce doing now? He's going back to his roots. Previously,
Shay, as Deep Plaid Games, developed a game for iOS called
[Connectrode](http://www.deepplaid.com/connectrode/Site/Connectrode.html). I've
downloaded it. I've played it. It's fun! I do wish it had updated graphics for
the Retina display, but that's not really a deal breaker. I have a lot of
respect for someone that can stick by his morals in the face of a situation like
his, and I'm happy to support him with the $0.99 contribution it cost me to play
Connectrode.

Lots of luck, Shay. I hope we see some more great things from you and from Deep
Plaid Games!
