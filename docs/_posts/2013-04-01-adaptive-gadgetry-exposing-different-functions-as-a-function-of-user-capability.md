What would you want to happen when you earn enough XP to level up your TV?

I found an interesting article over at Fast Company about the idea of building
devices that dynamically adjust the features that they expose to the user based
on the user's perceived abilities.  Interestingly, it's partially based on the
theory that drives many video games: experience points.

[The Next Big UI Idea: Gadgets That Adapt To Your
Skill](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672044/the-next-big-ui-idea-gadgets-that-adapt-to-your-skill#1)

The article is a great read, and the author covers almost all of the "yeah but"s
that came to mind except one.  The idea of making devices more accessible to
people who would be intimidated by their complexity is awesome, and I think the
concept described in the article tackles it very well.  My only concern would be
how much people might be thrown off by newly revealed complexity.  If, one day,
there were more buttons on my remote control, I would play with them to see what
they did.  Many people don't think this way, and would stay away from the new
buttons (something that is addressed in the article).  Still other people might
be so put off by the additions that the buttons they were already familiar with
may seem suddenly foreign (I know a few people like this).

There's no real way to tell how big of a problem that might be without trying it
out, but it's one case that the author doesn't seem to cover: what about people
who don't want to "level up"?
