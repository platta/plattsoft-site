This site has been idle for at least a year, I think. Â It's time to shake things
up a bit by moving to a new Content Management System so that I can focus more
on creating content and less on writing code to display it.

I've chosen [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) as my CMS, and as I have time
I'm going to start migrating content from the old site.
