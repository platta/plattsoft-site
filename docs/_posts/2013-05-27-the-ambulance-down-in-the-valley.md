A while back, I was discussing some of the nonsensical actions that people take
in the software industry with my parents during a visit. my mom told me to look
up a poem called _The Ambulance Down in the Valley_. I wrote it down and forgot
about it for months because I was in the middle of the last semester of my
Master's degree. I finally got a chance to look it up, and it really is a
beautiful illustration of the strange way we look to solve problems sometimes.

The story, essentially, involves a cliff that provides a beautiful scenic view,
but where many people also fall and injure themselves. As the poem goes...

> So the people said something would have to be done,
> but their projects did not at all tally;
> some said, "Put a fence 'round the edge of the cliff,"
> some, "An ambulance down in the valley."

I had trouble tracking down the original author, and there are a number of
different versions that end in different ways. It looks like many authors have
added to the original work. As I found
[here](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-ambulance-down-in-the-valley/), it
seems the original poem was written by Joseph Malins in 1895, and where his work
ends is where all the versions I've found differ, so I'm assuming that was all
the original author wrote.

Anyway, the great point that the above passage illustrates is that putting a
fence around the cliff wouldn't cost nearly as much as the ambulance down in the
valley. This parallels an important lesson in software engineering, the earlier
in the software lifecycle you catch a defect the less it costs to fix it. The
lesson does seem obvious, but you'd be amazed how often we lose sight of it.
Putting a fence around the cliff takes away some of the majesty of the view, so
it is not an attractive option to most. At the same time, putting extra effort
into quality early in the process of developing a piece of software isn't as
exciting as just pushing forward and getting the product finished so you can see
some results. The result is the same in both the poem and in real life, jumping
for the more attractive short term choice will hurt you in the long run.

Towards the end of the poem, a wise old man makes an observation that highlights
another great lesson for software engineers.

> Then an old sage remarked: "It's a marvel to me
> that people give far more attention
> to repairing results than to stopping the cause,
> when they'd much better aim at prevention."

As I read this part, I imagined someone approaching the situation from the
outside, after the ambulance in the valley was already in service. In software,
as well, bringing a fresh perspective to a situation can remove self imposed
obstacles and assumptions that we no longer see.

_The Ambulance Down in the Valley_ is a great example of the way that wisdom
from other disciplines often applies in the world of software engineering. There
a lessons for software engineers everywhere, we just have to remember to look.
