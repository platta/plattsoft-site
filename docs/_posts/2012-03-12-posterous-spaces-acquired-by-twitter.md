News is spreading rapidly that Twitter has acquired Posterous Spaces, a blogging
site whose tagline is simply "Share Smarter". Twitter has posted a blog post
[here](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/03/welcoming-posterous-team-to-flock.html),
and Posterous has posted to its official blog [as
well](http://blog.posterous.com/big-news).

A snippet from Twitter's post:

> Today we are welcoming a very talented group from Posterous to Twitter. This
> team has built an innovative product that makes sharing across the web and
> mobile devices simple—a goal we share. Posterous engineers, product managers
> and others will join our teams working on several key initiatives that will
> make Twitter even better.

and from Posterous' blog

> The opportunities in front of Twitter are exciting, and we couldn’t be happier
> about bringing our team’s expertise to a product that reaches hundreds of
> millions of users around the globe. Plus, the people at Twitter are genuinely
> nice folks who share our vision for making sharing simpler.

Both companies state up front that the services at Posterous spaces will not be
interrupted and that, should any changes be made, everyone will be given plenty
of notice. Posterous has also stated that they will soon be posting instructions
on how to migrate your Posterous content elsewhere if you choose to do so.

So what are the implications of this acquisition? As I first thought about it,
Twitter seemed to have been a fairly quiet company from what I remembered. Aside
from acquiring TweetDeck, I couldn't think of any other external activity like
this. I did a quick search to see if there had been any other acquisitions, and
I found [this](http://www.seobythesea.com/2011/01/twitter-acquisitions) post at
a blog called [SEO by the Sea](http://www.seobythesea.com). Here is the list of
acquisitions included in the post, see if you remember any of these guys:

- July, 2008 - Summize
- November, 2008 - Values of n
- December, 2009 - Mixer Labs
- April, 2010 - Atebits
- April, 2010 - Cloudhopper
- June, 2010 - Smallthought Systems
- December, 2010 - Fluther

Bill Slawski, the author of SEO by the Sea, has a great recap of what Twitter
actually acquired in each of these moves (people, technology, etc.), and it
really looks like that's what the acquisition of Posterous is all about. Based
on the postings, it looks like in this case Twitter wants the people who created
Posterous Spaces, not specifically Posterous itself. That said, will Twitter
keep Posterous Spaces up and running indefinitely? Will the original developers
still be involved? I guess it's too soon to tell, really, but I'm interested to
see what developments are on the way from this newly fortified Twitter team.

__03/13/2012 - Update:__ Today I happened upon
[this](http://www.fastcompany.com/1824394/why-twitter-bought-posterous-talent-and-apple)
article on [FastCompany](http://www.fastcompany.com) which delves more deeply
into the reasons behind the acquisition. It's definitely worth a read.
