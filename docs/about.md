# Who am I?

My background in technology is extensive, from self-teaching to school and
community participation to project work. I have spent years learning the nuances
of programming. I received a BS in Computer Science and MS in Software
Engineering.

- Collaborating with a PhD professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, I
  helped build an environment for performing automated combat testing of AI
  agents in large batches to feed Bayesian networks. Similar to neural networks
  in that they learn, the end aim was to develop stronger AI.
- In 2004 I built an in-house contract and license management system for my
  employer, a system that they still use today.
- Connecting with and fostering dialogue and community is really important to
  me. I was invited to speak at BriForum Denver in 2015, and my lecture was
  titled
  [“One Server to Rule THem All: How to Use PowerShell Desired State Configuratio to Automate Your Environment"](http://www.brianmadden.com/video/BriForum-2015-How-to-Use-PowerShell-Desired-State-Configuration-to-Automate-Your-Environment).
  The following year I spoke at PowerShell Summit in Washington, doing an
  [LCM Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBo83RSGKoM).
- And, just to share my human side, in my spare time I enjoy shredding on the
  bass guitar, solving puzzles, playing with my daughter and son, searching
  projects to do with Raspberry Pi, and tinkering with a mobile game I want to
  build. Lastly, I’m good at making analogies to explain complex technical stuff
  in simple terms- which is beneficial in a technically complex field like
  programming.
- I can also solve the Rubik’s Cube. Can you?
