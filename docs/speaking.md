## "I've always had a passion for sharing my knowledge and experiences."

*[Start a conversation](mailto:speaking@plattsoft.net)*

Technology has been a passion of mine for most of my life. I also have a passion
for sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. I've presented for
audiences ranging from over one hundred to less than ten. Whether I'm in a
conference hall, a conference room, or a classroom, I'm always enthusiastic
about helping my audience learn and grow.

Do you have a group of non-technical professionals that could benefit from a

Need to get your team up to speed on a newly adopted technology? I can work with

apart, piece by piece, and put it back together again.

## About me

I have been writing code since I was in diapers. Throughout my career my
interests have grown to include the entire Software Development Lifecycle,
DevOps practices, and Cloud Architecture. My passion to teach and share has led
me to present at conferences, start my own blog, advocate for technology inside
and outside of my company, and offer cross-training sessions for my coworkers on
a regular basis.

I still keep my hands on the tech, but I have also begun to focus more on
sharing my knowledge and experience. I enjoy talking about implementation
details, chatting about helping your employees feel valued, and pondering how to
stay motivated in our constantly evolving technological world.

## What to expect

Here are some of the things you can expect when working with me on a speaking
engagement.

- Prompt and professional replies to phone calls and e-mail messages.
- An in depth consultation to gain an understanding of your audience and your
  goals for them.
- A professionally prepared, dynamically delivered presentation built around
  your goals and designed to connect with your specific audience.
- A follow-up communication after the event to ensure I have met your
  expectations and allow you to share any other feedback you may have.

## The next step
