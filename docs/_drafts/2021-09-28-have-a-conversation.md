As my role has grown from purely programming into people leadership and product
management, one of the biggest lessons I've learned is the importance of having
conversations with people.

## Project going to be late? Have a conversation

<div class="card-body text-success">
<p class="card-text font-italic">

Don't get stressed, assert your needs for delivering quality.
</p>
</div>
</div>

Being behind schedule feels awful. Unfortunately, a lot of folks have become
conditioned to thinking that the only option in this situation is to figure out
how to get it done anyway - work nights and weekends, or cut corners and hope
nobody notices. But, there is something else you can do. You can have a
conversation with your stakeholders.

You still have to admit that you won't be able to hit your target, but that
doesn't have to be a bad thing. Stakeholders want quality. They want to minimize
expenses and adhere to agreed-upon timelines, sure. But, generally they don't
want to sacrifice quality for those things.

There have been many situations where I've gone to a customer a few weeks before
a deadline, told them about the challenges the project team is facing, and
proposed a new deadline for the sake of delivering quality. I have yet to have a
customer reject that proposal. They may not be thrilled, and that's ok. Also,
the closer to the deadline you communicate this, the harder it will hit, because
[nobody likes surprises]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url

best for everyone.

## Disagree with someone? Have a conversation

<div class="card mb-3 border-success">
<div class="card-body text-success">
<p class="card-text font-italic">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i>
Don't get mad, disagree and commit.
</p>
</div>
</div>

This is on the list of [Amazon's Leadership
Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles). It might not make sense the
first time you hear it, but it expresses the concept in a very concise way. It's
got a two-part meaning.

- Voice your disagreements openly. Get it off your chest.
- Commit to whatever choice the team/organization makes.

Remember, if it's not your decision to make, all you can do is make your case to
the decision maker. Your next responsibility is to get behind whatever decision
is made, even if it's not what you wanted. If you feel like you've been heard,
it's a lot easier to let go of the disagreement, and that helps the team stay
unified.

## Conflicting asks or too much on your plate? Have a conversation

<div class="card mb-3 border-success">
<div class="card-body text-success">
<p class="card-text font-italic">
<i class="fas fa-check"></i>
Don't get flustered, present facts and ask for a decision.
</p>
</div>
</div>

It's easy to get frustrated when your path isn't clear, or your plate is
overflowing. But, like with many other things, having a conversation with your
supervisor or team lead can help. These leaders should be working to ensure
everyone has clear priorities and a balanced workload. If you've got 5 things on
your plate when there's only room for 3, let your supervisor know. Walk them
through the current state of things, and ask them to help you set the
priorities.
